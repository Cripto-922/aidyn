      <h1>Wrong Turn: The Real Inspiration For The Movie Explained</h1>

        Given how outrageous and over-the-top the horror franchise is, it is<br />
        surprising that Wrong Turn is based on a true story to some extent.
        <br />With seven films to date, the Wrong Turn franchise has been
        something of a sleeper <br />hit with horror fans. The first movie in
        2003 follows a group of travelers who e<br />nd up meeting in the West
        Virginia backcountry after a cannibal family sabotages their cars and
        leaves <br />them vulnerable to being hunted. The original movie was the
        only installment to get a theatrical release; <br />the rest were
        launched in a direct-to-video format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three cannibals in Wrong Turn — Saw Tooth, One Eye, and <br />Three
        Finger — got more of a backstory in future installments, with Wrong Turn
        4 serving as a prequel to the series.<br />
        The movie embraced the extreme gore and violence, with few characters
        surviving. Even with the outlandish ways the franchise<br />
        evolved, the Wrong Turn series did originate at least a little bit in
        reality with the story of the Scottish murderer Sawney Bean.
